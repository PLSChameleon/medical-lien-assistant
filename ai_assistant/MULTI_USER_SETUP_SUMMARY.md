# Multi-User Setup Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. User Credential Management System
- **File**: `services/user_credential_manager.py`
- Securely stores credentials for multiple users
- Encrypts sensitive data (CMS passwords) using Fernet encryption
- Stores data in platform-specific user directories
- Each user's credentials are isolated and encrypted

### 2. Multi-User Gmail Service
- **File**: `services/gmail_multi_user_service.py`
- Extends existing Gmail service to support multiple users
- Each user has their own OAuth token
- All users share the same Gmail API project (credentials.json)
- Supports user switching and new user authentication

### 3. Multi-User CMS Integration
- **File**: `services/cms_multi_user_integration.py`
- Extends CMS integration for multiple users
- Each user has their own CMS username/password
- Credentials are encrypted and stored securely

### 4. Setup Wizard
- **File**: `user_setup_wizard.py`
- First-run wizard for new users
- Guides through Gmail OAuth authentication
- Collects and saves CMS credentials
- User-friendly interface with step-by-step instructions

### 5. Multi-User Launcher
- **File**: `multi_user_launcher.py`
- Main entry point for the application
- Shows user selection dialog for existing users
- Automatically launches setup wizard for new users
- Handles user switching

### 6. Launch Scripts
- **Windows**: `Launch_Medical_Lien_Assistant.bat`
- **Mac/Linux**: `launch_medical_lien_assistant.sh`
- Simple one-click launchers for users

## How It Works

### First-Time Setup (New User)
1. User runs `multi_user_launcher.py` or launch script
2. Setup wizard automatically appears
3. User enters Gmail address and completes OAuth
4. User enters CMS credentials
5. Credentials are encrypted and saved
6. Application launches with user's credentials

### Returning User
1. User runs `multi_user_launcher.py` or launch script
2. User selection dialog appears
3. User selects their account and clicks Login
4. Application launches with saved credentials

### Adding Additional Users
1. From user selection dialog, click "Add New User"
2. Complete setup wizard for new user
3. New user is added to the list

## Security Features

### Credential Storage
- CMS passwords are encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Gmail tokens use Google's OAuth2 security
- Credentials stored in user-specific directories:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\MedicalLienAssistant\`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/MedicalLienAssistant/`
  - Linux: `~/.config/MedicalLienAssistant/`

### Data Isolation
- Each system user has separate credential storage
- Users cannot access each other's credentials
- No credentials stored in source code

## Deployment Instructions

### For Your Colleague

1. **Copy the entire `ai_assistant` folder** to their computer

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Run the launcher**:
   - Windows: Double-click `Launch_Medical_Lien_Assistant.bat`
   - Mac/Linux: Run `./launch_medical_lien_assistant.sh`

4. **Complete first-time setup**:
   - Enter their Gmail address
   - Authorize Gmail access (browser will open)
   - Enter their CMS username and password
   - Click Finish

5. **Future use**:
   - Just run the launcher
   - Select their account
   - Click Login

## Important Files to Include

When sharing with your colleague, ensure these files are included:
- `credentials.json` - Gmail API project credentials (same for all users)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `multi_user_launcher.py` - Main launcher
- `Launch_Medical_Lien_Assistant.bat` - Windows launcher
- All files in `services/` directory
- `user_setup_wizard.py` - Setup wizard

## Testing Checklist

Before deployment:
- [x] Test setup wizard with new user
- [x] Verify Gmail authentication works
- [x] Verify CMS credentials are saved
- [x] Test user switching
- [x] Verify credentials are encrypted
- [x] Test on clean system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **"credentials.json not found"**
   - Ensure `credentials.json` is in the `ai_assistant` directory

3. **Gmail authentication fails**
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console

4. **CMS login fails**
   - Verify CMS credentials are correct
   - Check CMS website is accessible

## Notes

- Each user only needs to authenticate once
- Credentials persist across application restarts
- Users can have different Gmail and CMS accounts
- The Gmail API project (credentials.json) is shared by all users
