# ProHealth Email Automation System
## Executive Overview

### What We've Built
We've developed an intelligent email management system that automates the time-consuming task of following up with law firms about medical billing cases. This system saves hours of manual work while maintaining personalized, professional communication.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Automatic Case Prioritization**
The system reads your Excel spreadsheet of cases and automatically identifies which ones need attention:
- Cases with no recent contact (over 60 days)
- Active cases missing important information (date of injury)
- Old cases that may have settled (over 2 years old)
- Groups cases by law firm for efficient batch processing

### 2. **Smart Email Generation**
Instead of typing the same emails repeatedly, the system:
- Creates personalized emails for each case automatically
- Varies the wording to avoid sounding robotic
- Includes all necessary case details (patient name, date of injury, file number)
- Maintains your professional tone and style

### 3. **Learning Your Writing Style**
The system analyzes your past emails to match how you normally write:
- Studies your typical greetings and closings
- Learns whether you write formally or casually
- Maintains consistent communication patterns
- Updates its understanding as you send new emails

### 4. **Efficient Email Cache System**
- **Initial Setup**: Downloads your complete email history once (may take a few minutes)
- **Daily Updates**: Only fetches new emails (takes seconds, not minutes)
- Keeps everything organized for quick access
- No need to re-download everything each time
