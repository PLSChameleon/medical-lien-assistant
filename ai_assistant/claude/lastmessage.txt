ok but if we are using bootstrap colelctions why would it only grab data from the 500 cached emails as opposed to parsing my entire gmail account same as the stale cases command does?


Additionally, here is the errors i am getting when trying to run stale cases


> stale cases

ERROR: Error analyzing case 333925: 'Name'

ERROR: Error analyzing case 276295: 'Name'

I am thinking this might be because the columns in my xlsx are not named. Here is an example of 4 entries in the spreadsheet format

This is organized as follows.

PID Source File# Case Status PatientName DOI Salesman cemp_id Collector insurance MPID Provider Attny Id Lawfirm Attny Street Attny Suite Attny City Atttny State Attny Zipcode Attny Email Attny Phone OrigAmt Payments WriteOff Agreement Balance Agreement Balance Not Paid PaidPrior Assigned Bal Balance


A. CMS# also called PID B. PV# C. Case Status (a bit irrelevant for what we are doing but i can explainit to you if you want me to) D. Patient Name E. DOI (Date of Injury) F. not important G. collector ID (also not important at least not right now) H. Collector Name I. not important and so forth.


as you can see we use many of the fields such as STREET and CITY and such to add firms email addresses.


That isnt particularly important right now as we are focused on building this email assistant but ina while from now I will have you help me build an automated email sender which will utilize more of this data than we are right now.


For right now we are really just using the spreadsheet as reference for when a user types in a PV so we can find the info for that file then search for it in the gmail account but i figured i would give you a breakdown to help you out and hopefully fix this error analyzing case 'Name' error
