perfect. Now i am thinking we should add something that looks through the bootstrap cache for any files where no emails have been sent and then we build a cache of files where there has been no communication on them such as new files or files where no emails were ever sent to the firms. 

Then we can have an option to send out emails requesting the status of all of these files. I wrote up some old code that does this in the /automated directory inside my devops directory. Ideally I want to refrain from using a boatload of openai api hits so i am thinking we can do what i did in the code which is have a few different greeting/contact establish sentences and then a few different sentences requesting the status of the file and have our code generate all of the follow up emails using a mish mosh of the variety of sentences to make sure not every email is the exact same thing. 

Here is a typical status request email. 

"Hello Attorney,

Please get back to me when you can and let me know if you need any bills or reports so I can get them to you right away. Thank you for your time"
